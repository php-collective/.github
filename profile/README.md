# PHP Collective

**Building quality PHP libraries and tools for the community**

We are a collective of PHP developers focused on creating well-tested, standards-compliant libraries that solve common problems elegantly.

## Our Focus Areas

### Code Quality Tools
- **[code-sniffer](https://github.com/php-collective/code-sniffer)** - PHP CodeSniffer rules building on PSR-12 with many additional fixers
- **[awesome-php-sniffers](https://github.com/php-collective/awesome-php-sniffers)** - Curated list of PHP code sniffers and fixers

### Djot Markup
Djot is a modern light markup language (markdown/commonmark alternative/successor)

- **[djot-php](https://github.com/php-collective/djot-php)** - PHP parser for Djot markup language
- **[djot-intellij](https://github.com/php-collective/djot-intellij)** - Djot syntax highlighting for JetBrains IDEs (PhpStorm, IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm)
